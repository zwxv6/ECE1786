This assignment engages you in the first major topic of the course - the properties, meaning, viewing, and training of word embeddings (also called word vectors). This assignment must be done individually. The specific learning objectives in this assignment are:
1. To set up the computing environment used in this course.
2. To learn word embedding properties, and use them in simple ways.
3. To translate vectors into understandable categories of meaning.
4. To understand how embeddings are created, using two methods - the Skip Gram method, and the Skip Gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS) method, and to get a sense of trade-offs in the creation of embeddings.
