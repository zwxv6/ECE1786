In this assignment you will:
1. Make use of pre-trained word vectors as a basis for classifying text
2. Implement an Multi-Layer Perceptron and a Convolutional Neural Network architecture for text classification. Youâ€™ll explore some relevant hyperparameters, and look at the resulting trained features for insights.
3. Practice doing qualitative analysis of results.
4. Explore quantitative methods to explain the results.
5. Build an interactive application using Gradio https://gradio.app.
